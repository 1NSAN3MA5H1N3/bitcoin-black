### What is BitcoinBlack?

---

BitcoinBlack is a community based currency focussed on a fair distribution _"fee free and instant transactions over a secure, decentralized network."_

---

### Key Features

* BitcoinBlack utilizes a novel [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers instantaneous transactions with zero fees and unlimited scalability, making Bitcoin Black an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.
